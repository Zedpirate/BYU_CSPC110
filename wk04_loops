#Week 04 Learning Activity Loops

payment = float(input("What is the payment amount?: "))

if payment < 0:
	print("Sorry the payment cannot be negative.")
	payment = float(input("What is the payment amount?: "))

#When using "while" it creats a loop when conditions aren't met or "as long as"
#When the user inputs a number less than zero, it'll loop back and print the original input asking for the payment amount.

while payment < 0:
	print("Sorry the payment cannot be negative.")
	payment = float(input("What is the payment amount?: "))

print(f"The amount is ${payment:.2f}")


#Keep Looping while number is less than 10
number = float(input("What is your number?: "))
while number <= 10
	print("Sorry the number must be greater than 10.")
	number = input("What is your number?: ")
print("Loop finished")
